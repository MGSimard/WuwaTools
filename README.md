## About The Project

![WuwaTools Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/RKjr6kx.png)

This project was an excuse to learn the basics of TypeScript, naturally I end up spending more time wrangling with unrelated stuff, in this case being Drag & Drop.

Spent about 4 days bouncing between library to library. Eventually I settled with just using the regular Drag API which worked completely fine except for two issues; it didn't have animations and worst of all it had no sorting _(Can't easily re-arrange order within same row)_. This was a problem considering the use case being a tier list creator tool -- as I was about to throw myself at the mystical unknown topic of bounding boxes and whatnot I got a notification from github concerning DnD kit. Turns out [the guy](https://github.com/clauderic) has been rebuilding it from the ground-up to make it more accessible and released alpha packages and a showcase guide. [(Link to comment)](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/issues/1188#issuecomment-2161876989)

In short it's baller and it took 10-20 minutes to implement.

So anyways with that out of the way I'm not too certain if or what tool I want to do next. There's only so much effort I'm willing to put in for a study project which I'll probably never share with anyone. The major problem here is that Wuthering Waves does not have a public API so I have to write my own JSON file for data, this inherently means a whole bunch of data entry by looking at wikis or in-game info _(Without mentioning maintaining all of it between updates)_. Bit of a nightmare, so unless I develop a newfound passion for the game this project will see little updates.
